I developed a Blog Management System that allows users to create, read, and interact with blog posts in an engaging way. The system not only supports publishing and viewing articles but also includes a commenting feature where readers can share their thoughts. To make discussions more interactive, I added threaded replies, so users can respond directly to specific comments, creating a conversation-like structure under each post. This setup helps maintain clarity in discussions and improves user engagement. The project was built with a focus on simplicity and usability, making it a solid foundation for any blogging platform that requires community interaction.
